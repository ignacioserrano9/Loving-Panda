# Loving-Panda

Ironhack Videogame Project 

An update to the old Casio LCD Game Console, done as a viodeogame student project for the Ironhack bootcamp, made entirely in Javascript, HTML and CSS.

As it was made in a very short period of time, all sprites, collisions and texts are in a RAW state but it is playable non the less.


# Controls
Use the keyboard arrows to move the arms, your right arm (left on the screen) to stop the bees to hurt you, and the oposite one to push up the baby panda.

# Win-Lose
To win you must reach 2000 score by stopping bees, but be carefull, you only have two lives and just 2 bees can take you to game over, also letting the baby drop to the floor is also an insta Game Over.
